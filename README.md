# Data Analysis and Cleaning - Data Science Project

## Project Description

This project involves exploring and cleaning a real estate dataset, `train.csv`, using the Python library `pandas`. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis or for machine learning models. We aim to understand the structure of the data, identify and handle missing values, and prepare the data for future analyses.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas

## Dependency Installation

Ensure that `pandas` is installed. You can install it using `pip` if it is not already installed:

```bash
pip install pandas
